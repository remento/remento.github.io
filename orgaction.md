Dear Volunteer Coordinators,

The OrgAction Volunteer Management Service has permanently shut down effective September 3, 2016.

Creating and running the OrgAction service has been a great experience but my attention has shifted elsewhere. It has been a privilege to work with so many different organizations and I wish them all the best.

All OrgAction clients have transitioned to other services and I encourage you to contact them directly to learn about volunteering opportunities.

Sincerely,
Daniel Moore
