I have been riding Austin’s trails off and on since moving to town over 15 years ago – and my favorite park remains Walnut Creek. Overall its trails are smooth and fast but it does have an impressive log pile hidden within it that until recently, has always given me pause.  While this obstacle looks impressive, in reality it is a timid giant, not too demanding provided one commits (and leans back). 

Hitting that pile of logs harder each week has helped me focus on other parts of my life where instead of stopping – I should be peddling harder and holding on tight.
