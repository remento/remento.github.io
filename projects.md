### OrgAction Volunteer Management Service
OrgAction provided web portals to non-profit organizations for the purpose of registering volunteers online and collecting information with a series of custom web forms. Volunteers could register for shifts or be assigned to them by an administrator. Communication features like bulletin boards and email templates simplified the work of communicating with large volunteer bases.

However, I eventually had to shift my focus elsewhere, and after completing a multiyear wind down, the service shutdown in 2016.

### Other projects
