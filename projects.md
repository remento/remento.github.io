### OrgAction 
#### _OA Volunteer Management Service_
OA provided web portals to non-profit organizations for the purpose of registering volunteers online and collecting information with a series of custom web forms. Volunteers could register for shifts or be assigned to them by an administrator. Communication features like bulletin boards and email templates simplified the work of communicating with large volunteer bases. While no longer in operation, at its peak, OA managed information for over 50,000 volunteers and worked with organizations across the United States.

#### _OA Resurrected_
OA survives as a place for me to incubate projects and experiment with tech that I want to learn more about.
