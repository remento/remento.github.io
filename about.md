I have worked as a small business owner, developer, dev lead, and dev manager. Creative problem solving and the satisfaction of getting a challenging project done well have always been very satisfying for me. Find out more about what I have worked on at [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/memento).

And for some interesting pics of me and my family...
